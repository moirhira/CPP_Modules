Workshop Title

DevOps Workshop

Objective

The objective of this workshop is to introduce 1337 students to DevOps principles, infrastructure fundamentals, and cloud-oriented thinking, which are currently underrepresented in the Common Core curriculum.

Many students focus primarily on application-level development (web or mobile) without a clear understanding of how software behaves in real production environments. This workshop aims to bridge that gap by exposing participants to:

Infrastructure concepts

Containerization and orchestration

Monitoring and observability tools

By acquiring this knowledge early, students will be better prepared to adapt to current market expectations, where DevOps and infrastructure awareness have become essential skills for modern developers, regardless of their specialization.

Proposed Dates and Duration

From 13/02/2026 to 16/02/2026

Educational activities: 2 full days

Arrival and departure days included for logistics and accommodation

Workshop Format

The workshop will follow a hybrid format, combining:

Technical talks and live demonstrations

Hands-on practical labs

Interactive correction, discussion, and Q&A sessions with experienced guests

This approach ensures both conceptual understanding and practical skill acquisition.
